Q1. Consider a binary tree of N nodes (1 Root and N−1 descendants). Each node X is
related to the root node by a relation such as L, R, LL, LR, ... and so on, where:
- L  : X is the left child of Root (R).
- R  : X is the right child of Root.
- LL : X is the left child of the left child of Root.
- LR : X is the right child of the left child of Root.
… and so on by extending with L/R.

Write a program to find the sum of all magic parents in the tree.

Definition:
Magic parents are those nodes whose one child is a factor of the other child.
Nodes having only one child can never be Magic parents.

Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 100

Input format:
- The first line contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
- The second line contains an integer Root, which is the value of the root node.
- The next N−1 lines each contain a string S and an integer X separated by a space,
  where S is the relation between Root and X (e.g., L, R, LL, LR, …), and X is the
  node value at that position.

Output format:
- Print a single integer: the sum of all magic parent node values.

Sample Input
6
11
L 14
R 28
LL 7
LR 8
RR 14

Sample Output
11

Question: Minimize Operations on a Path (Weighted Tree)

You are given a weighted tree with N nodes and N−1 edges.
In one operation you may choose any edge and either increase its weight by 1
or decrease its weight by 1.

There are Q queries. Each query gives two nodes U and V.
For each query, determine the minimum number of operations required to make
the weights of ALL edges on the unique path from U to V equal.
If U = V, the answer is 0.

Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer N.
- The next N−1 lines each contain three space-separated integers:
  U V W, denoting an edge between nodes U and V with weight W.
- The next line contains a single integer Q.
- The next Q lines each contain two space-separated integers U V
  describing a query path.

Output Format
- Print Q space-separated integers, where the i-th integer is the answer
  to the i-th query.

Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ U, V ≤ N
- 1 ≤ W ≤ 26
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 1e5

4 7

Sample Output
5 3 5

Explanation (sketch)
For each query, the minimum number of operations equals the minimum over all
targets t of sum over edges e on the path of |w_e − t|.
This minimum is attained when t is a median of the path’s edge weights.
For (2,7), making all edges equal requires 5 operations; for (4,6) it is 3;
for (4,7) it is 5.
